# Motivation  
Since before TBC Classic launched, Bangle of the Endless Blessings and Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon have been and remain controversial trinkets. The reasons for player's disdain vary depending on who you ask, but the most common reasons that I've heard are: 1) Druid's don't need mana, 2) They lack +heal, and 3) Blue Dragon is bad because it is random. The first reason is laughably wrong, and any Druid worth their salt would know that mana is heavily constrained by encounter length and choice of rotation. The second reason, while true, depends on how you value mana. Blue Dragon has seen a fair amount of use in speedruns, and as encounters become longer in Sunwell Plateau I suspect Blue Dragon will become more popular within the general playerbase as well. Lastly, the third reason is not a reason at all. Consider this: if the proc chance were 99% instead of 2%, it is still bad *because* it is random? Blue Dragon's worth must be judged from a statistics argument, not whatever anecdote "I saw this player go 5 minutes without a proc!" is pulled out of a hat. Thankfully, I think players have wisened up to Blue Dragon's worth over time, but you will always find critics pop up whenever it is mentioned.
