# Motivation
TBC Resto Druid is a complicated spec. The rotation that you choose to use in an encounter can depend on several factors: how many tanks are there? How much mana do you have available? How much do you prioritize healing the tank vs the raid? Is the raid damage constant (Bloodboil, ROS, Azgalor) or sudden and unpredictable (Najentus)? While theorycrafting can determine the best rotations in a vaccuum, boss encounters are messy and effective healing is difficult to model accurately for every encounter.  

The motivation of this project is to take a data-driven approach to this problem; what are the top performing players *actually* doing on each boss? Furthermore, what are the best rotations given *your* specific raid composition? (For example: On Najentus if your raid has 4, 5, or 6 healers, whether you get innervate/Spriest or not, rolling HoTs on the tank or not, playing Nature's Grace or not, your kill times, etc.). There is a vast resource of data provided by WarcraftLogs that is currently not being used by the community (understandably, building a dataset is difficult and time consuming). Regardless of your skill level, I hope that the results of this analysis will help improve our understanding of the class.


# Elephant in the room
"Healing parses don't matter". Have you heard this before? Whenever I see Druids soliciting feedback online (reddit or elsewhere), this is the most common response. "Did your tank die? No? Then you're fine". Not only is this feedback unsatisfying, it's not advice. It's anti-advice, and it leaves the asker with the impression that there's no room for improvement. The hard truth for Druids is that rotations are not built equally. If I want to roll HoTs on the tank and do some raid healing, some rotations are just better than others. In my opinion HPS is the best KPI to compare rotations. While there are some shenanigans that occur in the 99th percentile of Druid parses (for example, Druids who just raid heal with Nature's Grace and ignore their tanks entirely), by aggregating large amounts of data these things are easy to filter out, and comparing Druids who are playing "honestly" becomes relatively straightforward.
